<h1 align="center">Marketing Analytics</h1>


IPSL-PAY is a fast-growing digital financial services company operating across multiple African markets. The company offers mobile-first financial products including instant micro-loans, savings wallets, bill payments, and merchant payment solutions targeted at underbanked and emerging middle-income users.

To drive user growth and revenue, IPSL runs multi-channel marketing campaigns across paid digital media (social, search, display). Campaigns range from always-on brand awareness initiatives to short-term seasonal promotions aimed at driving sign-ups and purchases of specific financial products.

As the marketing function scaled, the Head of Marketing identified the need for a centralized analytics model to track campaign performance, user acquisition, funnel progression, and revenue impact across markets and channels for 2024 marketing efforts. The business needed clear visibility into how users move from first exposure (impressions) through engagement (clicks), acquisition (sign-ups), and monetization (purchases), while also understanding marketing spend efficiency and return on investment. The key insights and recommendations focus on the following areas:

- Campaign Performance Trends:  
For each campaign, tracking marketing spend, impressions, clicks, sign-ups, purchases, and revenue over time.

- Funnel Performance & Channel Effectiveness:  
Analyzing user progression from awareness to conversion to identify drop-offs, acquisition efficiency, and conversion strength at each stage as well as determine most effective channels for each campaign type.

- Market Analysis:  
Assessing campaign reach and revenue performance across countries and markets to understand demand patterns and optimize market-level strategy.

<h2 align="center">Campaign Performance</h2>

1. **Overview**  
   - Across all campaigns, marketing efforts generated 1,189 impressions, 969 clicks, 770 sign-ups, and 672 conversions, showing strong progression through the funnel with limited drop-off. Total marketing spend was $16.73K, generating $29.99K in revenue; an absolute uplift of $13.26K, representing an approximate 79% increase over cost, indicating strong overall campaign efficiency and profitability.

2. Monthly Revenue vs. Cost Analysis Across All Campaigns for 2024  
   - Across all campaigns, revenue consistently outperformed cost every month, indicating sustained marketing profitability throughout the year. Peak performance occurred in May, where the highest revenue ($3.76K) was achieved alongside proportionally higher spend, suggesting effective scaling.
   - While revenue consistently exceeded costs throughout the year, the efficiency of spend varied by month. December recorded the lowest ROAS at 1.55, indicating the least return per dollar spent, whereas August achieved the highest ROAS of 1.85, reflecting the most efficient campaign performance during the year. This highlights the need to investigate factors driving lower efficiency in certain months, despite overall profitability.

3. Campaign Profitability Analysis: Revenue vs. Cost
   - Data showed the All Year Awareness campaign emerged as the most profitable, generating $23.35K in revenue from a $12.22K spend, with a ROAS of 1.91. In contrast, the Christmas Campaign had the lowest ROAS at 1.27, suggesting that while profitable, its efficiency per dollar spent was comparatively lower.
   - Its important to note that even amongst the short duration campaigns (which span for a month), the Christmas campaign returned the least, with Summer and New Year both exceeding a ROAS of 1.5.
